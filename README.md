# Limonade Project
Day to day data tracking for personal improvement, health diagnosis or self-care.

## Coding detail
Use daily logs to follow personal evolution with simple and scalable piece of data, or **Slice** in the code.

Using **Room** and basic key/value logs (slices), feedbacks types can be defined without changing anything but UI.

The architecture is similar to MVVM.

The data could be very private (like journal note, menstruation cycle or health mesure), 
for this reason no remote data sync is done, neither account registration. Everyting stay on the user phone only.
